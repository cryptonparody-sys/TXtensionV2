*Last updated: January 6, 2026*

---

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

Installing or using TXtension (“the Extension”) means you agree to these terms. If you do not agree, uninstall the Extension from your browser.

## 2. What TXtension Does

TXtension augments Twitter / X with a translation assistant. Core capabilities include:

- Capturing tweet text locally and requesting translations from AI providers you configure.
- Managing tone presets, default language settings, and clipboard/pinning behaviour in the control panel.
- Injecting a `TX` button into the Twitter / X interface to display translations inline.

TXtension does not post content automatically or manage your account. No guarantees are made regarding output accuracy, availability, or suitability for any specific purpose.

## 3. Your Responsibilities

- **Platform compliance** – You remain responsible for following Twitter / X policies and any applicable laws.
- **Review output** – Evaluate every translation before using it publicly.
- **API usage** – Acquire valid API keys and keep them secure. Usage fees, rate limits, and contracts with providers remain your responsibility.
- **Security** – Maintain a secure device and browser environment. TXtension stores keys locally and cannot protect compromised machines.
- **Custom endpoints** – If you configure a custom REST endpoint, ensure you are authorised to send the submitted content.

## 4. Acceptable Use

Do not use TXtension to:

- Generate or distribute illegal, abusive, or hateful material.
- Violate platform policies or automate behaviour that breaks site rules.
- Misrepresent your identity or mislead others.
- Attempt to reverse engineer, tamper with, or overload the Extension or connected services.

## 5. Privacy

TXtension processes tweet text in memory, stores preferences in `chrome.storage.local`, and communicates only with the AI services you enable. See the Privacy Policy for full details.

## 6. Changes & Termination

Features may change without notice. You may uninstall at any time. We may revoke usage if you violate these terms.

## 7. Disclaimer of Warranties

TXtension is provided “as is” without warranties of any kind, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. Use it at your own risk.

## 8. Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent allowed by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from use of the Extension. Liability for direct damages is limited to the amount paid (if any) for the Extension.

## 9. Contact

For questions, fork the project and handle support within your own release channel.
